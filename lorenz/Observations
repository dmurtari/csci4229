Observations:

The lorenz attractor seems to be very sensitive to changes in the parameters;
when any of the parameters get small, I noticed that the attractor's "loops"
all consolidate into one group, with one line coming off. For example, when 's'
gets small, the attractor quickly spiral around one point instead of two, but 
as 's' continues getting smalle, the spiral rapidly expands. 

As the parameters 's' and 'b' get larger, the attractor also changes and 
spirals around one point, similar to when the parameters get small. In contrast,
as the parameter 'r' gets large, the attractor continues to spiral around two 
points, and its radius appears to expand. 

I found that the Lorenz attractor describes the convection of a fluid heated
uniformly on the bottom and cooled uniformly on the top. An example of something
that can be described by the Lorenz attractor is the Earth's atmosphere's 
convection, where the atmosphere is heated uniformly below by the Earth, and 
cooled uniformly on top by space (http://hypertextbook.com/chaos/21.shtml)
